# pass_manager
Password manager i wrote for myself (pet project with NO ENCRYPTION). AES encryption will be added, but idk when.
Usage: 
1. Download "ddgrnPassManager.zip" in releases tab.
2. Come up with a key
3. Generate 256 HASH based on your key and put it inside KEYSHA256.txt.
4. Launch .exe file
5. Type your key and press Enter

Application stores key only in SHA256 format, so if you forgot the key, you cannot restore it (only brutforce or search in sha256 databases).
Application does not encrypt passwords themselves so they are accesible in application folder. If you want to implement encryption just fork.
